Greater Than or Less Than - Endpoint
CODE: This code takes in a user's input in the url and then displays whether the first number inputted is less than, greater than, or equal to the second number
Peer Review by Griffin Parker: This program works perfectly and does everything it needs to. The code is organized and everything looks good. Great work! 

Instructions: Run the debug on the code. 
In Postman open a new request window. 
Type in https://localhost:7186/ *This is the port number you obtained after you debugged the C# program. It is found in the debug console. Yours may differ.* 
Then type in evaluate/values/ *This is the name of the controller and endpoint route to target*
Then type in your first number followed by a slash.
Then type in your second number.
It should all look similar to this https://localhost:7186/evaluate/valuse/{first number}/{second number}
